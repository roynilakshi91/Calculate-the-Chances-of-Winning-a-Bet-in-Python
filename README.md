# Hacker statistics to calculate your chances of winning a bet

Case Study: 
You are taking a stairs in empire state building and playing a game with your friend. You throw a die one hundred times.
If it's 1 or 2 you'll go one step down. If it's 3, 4, or 5, you'll go one step up.
If you throw a 6, you'll throw the dice again and will walk up the resulting number of steps. Of course, you can not go lower than step number 0. And also, there is a chance of 0.1% of falling down the stairs when you make a move. Falling down means that you have to start again from step 0. With all of this in mind, you bet with your friend that you'll reach 60 steps high.
What is the chance that you will win this bet?
